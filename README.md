1. Gods Goodneſs Vindicated, For the help of ſuch, (eſpecially in Melancholy) as are tempted to deny it, and think him cruel, becauſe of the preſent and future miſery of mankind with reſpect to the Doctrine of Reprobation and Damnation.
II. The falſhood and vexation of ſuch mens thoughts, whether the Melancholy or others are brought toQueſt. 1. Is it not certain

that there is a world, in which is abundance of Created Goodneſs? The EQueſt. 2. Is not all the Goodneſs of the whole Creation communicated from God? Did it make it ſelf? Queſt. 3. Hath God made a world that is better than himſelf? Could he give more goodneſs than he hadQueſt. 4. Is he fit to be quarrelled with for want of Goodneſs, who hath infinitely, more Goodneſs tQueſt. 5. Muſt not God neceſſarily excell his works? muſt he needs make every worm a God? or muſt heQueſt. 6. Is not Gods Creation a harmonious Ʋniverſe, of which Individuals are but the parts: Are noQueſt. 7.

by the Intereſt of Murderers in the Goal? whenQueſt. 13. Do not all men in the World confeſs Gods Goodneſs firſt or laſt? Do not all true believerQueſt. 14. What if it were but one or two in a whole Kingdom that were damned, and that only for obſQueſt. 15. Have you ſo good acquaintance with the extent of the univerſe, the ſuperiour World▪ the nQueſt. 16. Are you well acquainted with the nature and degrees of the future miſeries which tempt yoQueſt. 17. And tell me, Is he fit to entertain ſuſpicions and quarrels with God▪ who knoweth God to Queſt. 18. Yea is this accuſing God, a fit employment for that perſon, who liveth in a Land of merciQueſt. 19. Would you thus argue or quarrel againſt Gods Greatneſs and Wiſdom, as you do againſt his Queſt. 20. Laſtly, now Conſider, whether evidently, the root of all this ſin be not (beſides MelanchII. I am next briefly to detect the falſe opinions, which do ordinarily cauſe theſe perſons errours,1. It is falſe doctrine to affirm that God condemneth the greater part of his Intectual Creatures (a2. It is not true that God decreeth to condemn any man but for ſin (for ſin, I ſay, as the cauſe of 3.

Adam could have ſtood when he fell, without any more Grace than that which he abuſed and neglecte10. For ought any can prove, multitudes that believe not, now, but periſh, may have rejected a help 11. All men have power to do more good, and avoid more Evil than they do; And he that will not do wh12.

And what if men cannot here tell how to reſolve the queſtion, Whether any, or how many are ever 15. I conclude in general, that nothing is more ſure than that God is moſt Powerful, Wiſe and Good, In the Concluſion, I take it to be wholſome adviſe to thoſe that are under this Temptation:1. That t1.
